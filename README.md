# Classification
Accuracy of logistic regression and decision tree classifier is checked using ROC.
This is a terse script which implements scikit learn in the classification of binary cases, it compares the accuracy of a decision tree against that of logistic regression.
This comparison was done using an R-squared measure, confusion matrix and a ROC graph - my favourite being the ROC graph (see documentation for more details).
Please note: attempt to print and save the decision tree graph was note successful using graphviz - work around was call the dot-data in the IPython console.
